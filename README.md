# Student_DBMS
Using Python as the main language and its module "tkinter" as a base for the Graphical User Interface(GUI), the Student_DBMS Project is using MySQL Server to Add, Manage, and Review the data from the "sdms" database. The MySQL Server is connected with the Python code using the "pymysql" module.
